    <p>I am Raghu iam from koilkuntla (town) Kurnool (dist). iam recently completed my graduation in SVR engineering college as a electrical engineer, in my last project I gain the skills like teamwork and collaboration. I want to change my carrier into the IT sector because I am passionate about coding that's the reason I'll join a coding BootCamp to learn the full stack web developer course, in the last project I created a sign in and login page where the user will fill their details I completed the frent end course and I think I am fit for this job.</p>
